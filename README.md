## Core Features

* [cite_start]**Custom Optimization Engine:** A multi-objective optimization engine for brick placement, balancing cost and piece variety. 
* [cite_start]**Advanced Image Processing:** A pipeline using OpenCV and computer vision algorithms for pixelation, color mapping, and region detection. 
* [cite_start]**Automated 3D Model Generation:** Programmatically generates multi-part 3D models in LDR/MPD format. 
* [cite_start]**Automated PDF Instructions:** Integrates with LPub3D to automatically produce multi-page, professional-quality building instruction manuals. 
* [cite_start]**Data-Driven Inventory:** Supports integration with LEGO Pick-a-Brick and other sources for real-time inventory and pricing data.
